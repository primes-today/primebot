# primebot

**Note:** this is a work in progress.

primebot is a bot for posting prime numbers to places like [Mastodon][] or
[Twitter][]. It's meant to replace [_primes_][primes] while being both tested
and maintainable.

Right now, it's maintainable. However, it is not yet fully tested, and Twitter
support is not implemented.

You can follow the magic at:

* Mastodon: [@primes](https://botsin.space/@primes) on the [botsin.space][]
  instance
* Twitter: [@\_primes\_](https://twitter.com/_primes_)
